career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I have a wide spread list of research interests including non commutative algebra, graph theory and machine learning. I love to learn and enjoy doing research to tackle technical problems. With nearly seven years of teaching experience, communication of technical ideas to a diverse audience is natural.

      Recently I have transitioned mostly to development and project management of machine learning systems. I focus on developing systems that reduce tedious tasks for humans in order to gain insight into data and maximize return on investment.

experiences:
    - role: Senior Data Scientist 
      time: Aug 2018 - Present
      company: Insitute for Defense Analyses
      details: |
        Conducted research to provide complete, rigorous, and non biased information for government decision makers.
          - Managed a team of data scientists to evaluate infrastructure needs for the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center. This consisted of aggregating data from over 30 different data sources into a SQL database that feeds multiple real time, automatically updating, interactive visualizations.
          - Developed natural langauge processing system that reduced document selection time from 100+ hours of human effort to less than 10 hours of computational time and minutes of human effort.
          - Developed proof of concept named entity recognition (NER) and entity resolution (ER) system that led to 1 million dollar contract to begin developing production model. Proof of concept was completed on time and 35 thousand dollars under budget.
          - Oversaw and executed mulitple large scale web scraping endeavours to collect useful data for analyses for a variety of projects. Scraping was done using specialized code written using automated test software.
